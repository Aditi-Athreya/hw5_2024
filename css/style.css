/* Step 1 
Animate the logo with keyframes. It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded.*/

/* Step 2
Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup.  It should also use the image “concrete_seamless.png” as a background-image with a backup color of #f1f1f1. */

Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example.*/

header {
  display: flex;

/* Step 4
Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex. */

Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited. This is a “challenge” problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it. */

/* Step 6
Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following:
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom,
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.
Check your work. The corners probably aren’t curving quite as you expected. Use Inspect Element to fix this problem. You will need to utilize a second selector. */

  /* Step 12
  Edit the css for the pricing and card classes to match our example. Part of achieving this is by using a flex-property to specify a “size” of 275px. */

  .pricing {
    display: flex;

  Change the font on your body to Arial with a backup value of  Helvetica
  The background image should be removed*/
  body {

  Edit the nav/nav_links elements*/

Edit the pricing class so that the elements align along the bottom*/

The card elements should have a solid border 2px of #45ADDD and use flex-basis of 325px. */

.card {

  flex-basis: 325px;
}

/* Step 20 
No part of the gallery should be visible */

#gallery, .gallery {

Without using list-style-type add the thumbs up entity as shown in the cards. */
